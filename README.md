# yolov5-pytorch-InterRealsense

yolov5 detection and distence location based on inter realsense d435i 

## Introduction

This is a developed yolov5 algorithm using inter realsense d435i based on pytorch.

## New features

This repository contained revised "datasets.py" and "test.py" which allow to use Inter Realsense D435i camera for detecting and measuring distence.
This repository initially contained customlized dataset of some arrows and buckets allowed to test the funciton.
When arrows are detected and confirmed, slopes will be printed in the terminal. You can manually annotate the certain code in the "test.py".
